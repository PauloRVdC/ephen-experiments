# ephin-experiments
event prediction experiments with ephin and other information network embedding methods

GraphEmbeddings submodule based on https://github.com/shenweichen/GraphEmbedding but the used algorithms work with tf 2.x

## install
inside GraphEmbeddings directory run
```
python setup.py install
```

## dataset
networkx (https://networkx.org) graphs with a DistilBERT-multilingual (https://huggingface.co/distilbert-base-multilingual-cased) embedding can be found at:
